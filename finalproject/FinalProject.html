<title>Microclimate Analysis in Des Moines, Iowa</title> 

<body> 
 
<h1> Sedi Ghiasi</h1> 
<p>This project examines the microclimate variability of Des Moines, Iowa, with a focus on the impact of trees and building ratios. By combining Tableau and R, we analyze and visualize real-world data to gain insights into how these factors affect the local climate. Through this analysis, we aim to better understand the complex relationship between urban development and microclimate conditions, and to identify potential strategies for mitigating negative impacts on human health and comfort.as this study is a part of my PhD work, only a part of it is included using altered numeric values. </p>
