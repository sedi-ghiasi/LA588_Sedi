# __Sedi's LA558 Portfolio__
Sedigheh Ghiasi is a Ph.D. student in Geology at Iowa State University in the Geological and Atmospheric Science Department. Her research is supervised by Dr. Yuyu Zhou from the Geology and Atmospheric Science Department and Professor Ulrike Passe from the College of Design as co advisor. Sedigheh research is interdisciplinary study that brings together urban energy management and using remote sensing techniques.
Before pursuing her Ph.D., Sedigheh obtained a Master of Science degree in Architecture. During her master's program, she worked on developing a GIS-based interactive map to identify feasible locations for P.V. panel installation. Her work in this area helped her develop a strong foundation in sustainability, particularly in urban environments.
Currently, Sedigheh is exploring other aspects of sustainability in urban environments, explicitly considering the evapotranspiration effect of urban vegetation on urban energy use. Sedigheh uses satellite-based techniques to provide the required inputs to conduct her research. With her expertise in urban environments, she is also predicting the potential impact of urban land use change on urban energy use.
