        <h1>Adding an OpenStreetMap to an HTML page</h1>
        <h2>Lecture 3a</h2>
        In this scenario, I wanted to share the location of a fictional area of concern. <br>
        Maybe this is a damaged sidewalk or a bad pothole
        
       <p>One method to do this would be to just share the URL link to an OSM map.<br>
        <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=42.51115&mlon=-94.17502#map=18/42.51116/-94.17502&layers=N">https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=42.51115&mlon=-94.17502#map=18/42.51116/-94.17502&layers=N</a> </p>
        
        <p>Note an alternative to that URL woudl include a parameter of CN for the layers as below. When we pass variables to a mapping application we can do this in the URL using a GET() statement or as values submitted from a form using a POST() statment. There are other methods, but these are the two primary protocols.<br>
            Take note that in this second link I utilized a Target parameter for the hyperlink so that the browser would open my map in a new window. 
            <br><br>
        <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=42.51115&mlon=-94.17502#map=18/42.51116/-94.17502&layers=N" target ="_blank">https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=42.51115&mlon=-94.17502#map=18/42.51116/-94.17502&layers=N</a> </p>
        

        
        <!-- This is an HTML comment  The text below is copied directly from OSM's share HTML option -->
        <p>Or you could embed the map using what is called an iframe</p>
        <iframe width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="https://www.openstreetmap.org/export/embed.html?bbox=-94.17946100234987%2C42.50883318601868%2C-94.17057216167451%2C42.51347955676637&amp;layer=mapnik&amp;marker=42.511154437388946%2C-94.17501926422119" style="border: 1px solid black"></iframe><br/><small><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=42.51115&amp;mlon=-94.17502#map=18/42.51116/-94.17502&amp;layers=N">View Larger Map</a></small>
        <br>
        Ideally I could add an image into a pop-up for the blue marker, but since this is an embedded map I have limited capabilities, so instead an image below. For this demonstration I am just linking to an image already on the Web, but I could have also added my own picture to GitHub and linked to it.
